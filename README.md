# R Package Sociometrics

# Managing and analyzing timestamped sociometric data

Collection of R tools for working with wearable sensors data, specifically Sociometric badges ((Humanyze, 
  formerly Sociometric Solutions). Most functions are utilities for reading EXCEL files exported from the
  Sociometric DataLab and parse those into a tidy data format.   
  
  Sociometric badges incorporate four sensors: Bluetooth, Infrared, Microphone or Accelerometer.  
  
  The package provides for quick explorations of these different data types and derived measures as well as 
  more specific functionalities to feed sociometric data to other downstream analysis. 
  
  The devepment of the code has been carried out within the framework of the H2020
  [GEDII](http://www.gedii.eu) project, which has received ffunding from the European Commission under the 
  Grant Agreement nยบ 665851.
