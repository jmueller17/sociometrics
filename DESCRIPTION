Description: Collection of tools for working with sensor derived sociometric data. Most functions are utilities
  for reading EXCEL files exported from the Sociometric DataLab and converting these into 
  tidy data frames. Sociometric data include "Interactions" based upon Bluetooth- and Infrared sensors.
  Bluetooth provides information about physical "proximity" while Infrared data indicates face-to-face
  interaction. Microphone derived measures include volume, pitch, speech- and participation profile, 
  turn-taking as well as different frequency bands. Accelerometer data include body activity, posture,
  and corresponding mirroring data.
  The package provides for quick explorations of these different data types as well as more specific 
  functionalities to feed sociometric data to other downstream analysis. 
  The devepment of the code has been carried out within the framework of the H2020 \href{http://www.gedii.eu}{GEDII} project, 
  which has received financing from the European Commission under the Grant Agreement nº 665851.
